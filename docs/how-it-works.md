```

Each iteration:

1. Build a prompt with the search space, best result, last 20 experiments, and per-epoch training curves
2. Ask the LLM to propose a batch of configs as JSON
3. Validate and clamp the response (fall back to random on any parse failure)
4. Train each config, tracking per-epoch train loss, val loss, and val accuracy
5. Log everything to JSONL, update best
6. Repeat

## What the LLM sees

Most tuning tools give the optimizer a single number: *"this config scored 0.85."*

swarmopt shows the full picture:

```
lr=0.05, activation=relu, use_residual=False:
  ep1:  train=2.30  val=2.28  acc=0.12
  ep2:  train=1.45  val=1.52  acc=0.41
  ep3:  train=0.82  val=1.35  acc=0.53
  ep4:  train=0.31  val=1.61  acc=0.48   ← val rising = overfitting
  ep5:  train=0.09  val=1.89  acc=0.45

lr=8.8e-4, activation=gelu, use_residual=True:
  ep1:  train=1.92  val=1.85  acc=0.28
  ep2:  train=1.01  val=0.98  acc=0.62
  ep3:  train=0.62  val=0.71  acc=0.74
  ep4:  train=0.41  val=0.52  acc=0.81   ← both dropping = good fit
  ep5:  train=0.33  val=0.43  acc=0.85
```

The system also pre-computes signals like `OVERFITTING: train 2.30→0.09, val 1.52→1.89, gap=1.80` so the LLM doesn't have to do the math.

## Why this works better than Bayesian optimization

Bayesian methods (Optuna TPE, Gaussian processes) build a statistical surrogate from `(config, score)` pairs. They learn correlations but have no domain knowledge — they don't know that high learning rates cause oscillation, or that dropout hurts underfitting models.

The LLM starts with ML knowledge and reads the training curves to understand *why* something worked or didn't. It can reason about interactions: "this config overfits because the model is too big for this dataset and has no regularization" rather than just "this config scored poorly."

## Fallback behavior

If the LLM returns invalid JSON, times out, or the API is down, the system silently generates random configs from the search space. A fallback counter tracks how often this happens. No exceptions propagate — the search continues no matter what.

## LLM backends

Auto-detected in order:

| Backend | How | Overhead |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Claude (Haiku 4.5) | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var | ~1s/call, ~$0.01/15-eval run |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var | ~1-2s/call |
| Local Qwen 2.5 1.5B | `--backend qwen` | ~3s/call, runs on CPU |
| Random search | `--backend none` | Baseline comparison |
